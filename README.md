## Project Overview


This document outlines the plan to repurpose an old computer with a Core 2 processor into a fully functional home media and automation center for a future residence in Mexico. The goal is to maximize the utility of existing hardware while implementing modern software solutions to manage media and smart home devices efficiently.


## Objectives


- Transform legacy hardware into a reliable media and home automation hub.
- Utilize open-source and lightweight technologies to ensure optimal performance.
- Maintain a professional and scalable architecture for future expansion.


## Hardware Specifications


- **Processor:** Intel Core 2 or similar
- **Memory:** Minimum 2GB RAM (upgradeable if necessary)
- **Storage:** Minimum 250GB HDD or SSD
- **Connectivity:** Ethernet/Wi-Fi adapter, USB ports
- **Peripherals:** Monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers


## Software Stack


### Operating System


- **Linux Distribution:** Ubuntu Server or Debian (lightweight and well-supported)


### Media Center


- **Kodi:** Open-source media player and entertainment hub
- **Plex Media Server:** For media streaming across devices


### Home Automation


- **Node.js:** Suitable for lightweight server-side applications and real-time communication
- **Homebridge:** Integrates smart home devices with Apple HomeKit
- **Node-RED:** Visual programming tool for wiring together hardware devices and APIs


### Alternative Technologies


- **.NET Core:** Viable for building cross-platform applications; however, may require more system resources than Node.js
- **Home Assistant:** Comprehensive home automation platform with broad device support


## Implementation Plan


1. **System Preparation**
   - Clean and inspect the old computer hardware
   - Upgrade RAM and storage if necessary
   - Install chosen Linux distribution


2. **Media Center Setup**
   - Install and configure Kodi and/or Plex
   - Organize media files and libraries
   - Set up remote access and streaming capabilities


3. **Home Automation Setup**
   - Install Node.js and configure Homebridge and Node-RED
   - Integrate smart devices (lights, thermostats, security systems)
   - Develop automation workflows and user interfaces


4. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test media playback and streaming performance
   - Validate automation workflows and device responsiveness
   - Optimize system performance and resource usage


5. **Deployment**
   - Install the system in the new home
   - Ensure network connectivity and device compatibility
   - Provide documentation and training for household members


## Considerations


- **Power Consumption:** Monitor and optimize for energy efficiency
- **Security:** Implement firewalls, secure access protocols, and regular updates
- **Scalability:** Design system architecture to accommodate future expansions


## Conclusion


Repurposing an old Core 2 computer into a home media and automation center is a cost-effective and sustainable solution. By leveraging lightweight and open-source technologies such as Node.js and Homebridge, the system can deliver robust functionality while maintaining performance on legacy hardware. .NET Core may also be considered for specific applications requiring its capabilities.
